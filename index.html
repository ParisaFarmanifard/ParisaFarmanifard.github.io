        Welcome to my webpage! My name is Parisa Farmanifard, I'm a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at <em>Michigan State University (MSU)</em>. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://iprobe.cse.msu.edu/people.php" style="text-decoration:underline;color:#3352FF">Dr. Arun Ross</a> in the <a href="https://iprobe.cse.msu.edu/index.php" style="text-decoration:underline;color:#3352FF">iPRoBe Lab</a>. 

    I earned my bachelor's degree in IT Engineering in 2017. Before joining MSU, I worked in the industry for 4 years. Alongside my PhD, I also completed my master's degree at MSU. My research focuses on Computer Vision, Biometrics, and Pattern Recognition.

        <h3>Research</h3>
            My research primarily focuses on <strong>cross-spectral face and iris recognition</strong> and <strong>iris segmentation</strong>. These areas involve exploring how to improve identification methods across different spectral ranges and how to accurately segment the iris for recognition. This work is crucial for advancing security and identification technologies.

        <h2>Internship and Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
            In the summer of 2023, I had an enriching internship experience at <strong>American Electric Power (AEP)</strong>, working with their emerging technology group. My role involved a project on <em>drone-based pole detection</em>, collaborating closely with a computer vision and machine learning group. During my PhD, I have worked with various detection methods, including <strong>Detectron2, Yolov4, Yolov8</strong>, and the <strong>Segment Anything Model (SAM)</strong>, primarily focusing on drone images.
